# Machine Learning Model for Predictive Maintence
 A major problem faced by businesses in asset-heavy industries such as manufacturing is the significant costs that are associated with delays in the production process due to mechanical problems. Most of these businesses are interested in predicting these problems in advance so that they can proactively prevent the problems before they occur which will reduce the costly impact caused by downtime. Please refer to the playbook for predictive maintenance for a detailed explanation of common use cases in predictive maintenance and modelling approaches.
